# All-in-at-the-end
Project Overview
Genre: Roguelike / Gambling / Narrative
 Theme: Death, chance, regret
All In at the End is a narrative-driven roguelike where the player wakes up in a casino run by Death. Instead of gambling money, the player bets pieces of their soul—memories, emotions, and years of their life.
Each gambling table (slots, poker, roulette, dice) represents a different mechanic. Winning extends your life. Losing permanently alters your character’s personality, dialogue options, abilities, and ending.
The game blends chance-based systems with permanent narrative consequences.
